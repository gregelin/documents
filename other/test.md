Happy to accept pull requests, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Swift Version

Since the Swift language is constantly evolving I have adopted a versioning scheme mirroring Swift versions:
the framework version's **first two digits are always the Swift version** the library is compatible with, see [releases](https://github.com/p2/OAuth2/releases).
Code compatible with brand new Swift versions are to be found on a separate feature branch named appropriately.


Usage
-----

To use OAuth2 in your own code, start with `import OAuth2` (use `p2_OAuth2` if you installed _p2.OAuth2_ via CocoaPods) in your source files.

A typical code grant flow is used for demo purposes below.
The steps for other flows are mostly the same short of instantiating a different subclass and using different client settings.
Still not working?
