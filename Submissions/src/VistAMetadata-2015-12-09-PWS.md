# PART 1: GENERAL INFORMATION

## 1.1 Objective

The objective of this performance work statement (PWS) is to prototype and demonstrate the exposure, analytics, and automation of VA VISTA metadata using modern, machine-processable, web-centric metadata standards, providing a single comprehensive security-enabled read/write data model for all VA VISTA data across all VA VISTA operational systems, establishing a common technical foundation for master data management and computable data representation and exchange between VA and DoD clinical information systems. 


## 1.2 Background

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest integrated healthcare delivery system in the United States with over 1,700 sites of care serving 8.76 million Veterans. The mission of VHA is to honor America's Veterans by providing exceptional healthcare services lifelong for all veterans in need, and to provide the highest quality care, everywhere.

The Veterans Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA)1 is a nationwide, comprehensive patient-centric integrated inpatient-outpatient Electronic Health Record (EHR) designed for and by VA clinicians to support all VHA clinical and business functions, and manages all veteran healthcare data and transactions. VISTA’s database is the Congressionally-designated authoritative data source for all Veterans health care delivery throughout the United States.  VISTA is production-proven for over thirty years, and is familiar to and has been used by 65% of all physicians in the United States.  VISTA is purpose-built for VHA and contains over three decades of institutional know-how of all business processes and patient care protocols of the VHA, in addition to over thirty years of patient data, and currently continues to grow at a rate of over one million additional lab tests, medication orders, imaging studies, and documents each day.  The cumulative knowledge and data stored in VISTA today is in the hundreds of billions of facts in structured, computable (but nonstandard) form. VISTA is also the evidence-based data engine that continuously validates all data and transactions (over 50 million real-time quality and safety checks on all patient care data and transactions each day) and is thus an essential tool in supporting VHA’s mission of consistently and reliably providing the safest, highest quality, lifelong care for all veterans, everywhere. VISTA has received Presidential awards for all these accomplishments, and continues today to consistently rank highly in national surveys by physicians for user satisfaction and for supporting high quality care2.

In order to meet changing clinical and regulatory requirements VA must continuously evolve VISTA.  The requirements of Public Law 113-066 (P.L. 113-066), SECTION 713 – “ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS,” of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 state that by December 31, 2016, VA must achieve an interoperable EHR with an integrated display of data with the Department of Defense (DoD) and private sector providers. The interoperable EHR must exchange all relevant health care data between DoD and VA computable in near real time.

This NDAA Congressional mandate for VA-DoD EHR interoperability is to a higher standard of interoperability than required for private sector EHRs under the U.S. Health and Human Services Health Information Technology (HIT) Meaningful Use (MU) incentive program. Meaningful Use Stage 3 certification3 (the latest version as of 2015) requires that a EHR shall be capable viewing, downloading, or transmitting a specially-formatted continuity of care document (CCD) from another EHR within four days of service for at least 50% of transitions of care4.  The information content of the CCDs, however, is inconsistent between implementations leading to unpredictable data quality 5, rendering the data non-computable. Meaningful Use standards thus provide only a fraction of the information in the EHR (only specific documents) only a fraction of the time (50% of transitions) and are not computable (viewable only) nor real-time (four days latency).  The VA and DOD are currently meet higher standard of interoperability than this Meaningful Use standard by virtue of use of the Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV).

To meet the more stringent Congressional NDAA mandate for the computable exchange of data, both VA and DoD require precise, granular, machine-computable definition of the data and metadata across all their authoritative primary source information systems at the data element level, not at the document-level.  VA and DoD therefore need to future-enable their EHR data by using modern, machine-processable metadata standards to express the data within all their existing diverse EHR systems. Such a metadata-centric approach was recommended by the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology in their Report to the U.S. President to realize the full potential of Health Information Technology to improve healthcare for Americans6.

The DoD’s Defense Health Agency (DHA) has successfully demonstrated a modern metadata-centric approach to exposing and managing the data in DHA’s authoritative clinical information system, the Composite Health Care System (CHCS), which, like the VISTA database in VHA, contains virtually all of the health agencies’ structured clinical data. (DHA has a separate database for documents, which are all unstructured). This project was the Transition Application Plan Support (TAPS) and was carried out at the Pacific Joint Information Technology Center (PJITC). The objective of TAPS was to support the transition of all CHCS systems and data to an industry-standard, machine-processable metadata representation in support of migration of all CHCS data for their future architecture. The TAPS project successfully demonstrated translation of a live CHCS system and all its data and metadata in fully machine-processable form using the Linked Data standard. 

Linked Data7, also known as the Resource Description Framework (RDF), is the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)8 Internet standard for representing machine-processable structured data and metadata on the web, and enables distributed, heterogeneous data query and integration at web scale. The world’s largest search engines all use a common RDF model to structure and index the data within the billions of web pages to support semantic search across all structured data on the web.9 Other Federal agencies have adopted Linked Data (RDF) to support master data management including the National Library of Congress to index and search all published works10, the U.S. National Library of Medicine to index and catalog the world’s largest collection of clinical and lifesciences publications11, and the U.S. HealthData.gov to publish thousands of public structured health datasets 12.  With this convergence of the federal health agencies on this common metadata standard, this means patient data can be linked across agencies and also to a wealth of health-related resources.

The VA VISTA Metadata Audit, Analytics, and Automation project intends to use the knowledge and expertise gained by DoD through the TAPS project as a springboard from which to prototype a new, common, shared interagency approach for machine-processable metadata management for current operational systems in VA and DoD using modern, international, web-standard, web-scale representation. 

VHA will be converging to the DHA TAPS approach in the ongoing efforts in Pacific JITC to support a common Linked Data (metadata) approach to enterprise metadata management, and support convergence on metadata standards and master data management between departments. The strategic advantage for VHA to collaborate with DHA at this close technical level is specifically to leverage the expertise of DHA in its TAPS work on DoD’s CHCS and to replicate this for VA’s VISTA.  This will allow VHA and DHA to converge on this metadata-centric approach, and enable the departments to use shared tooling and expertise going forward.

The objective of this project is to develop and demonstrate repeatable, scalable, automation of metadata management across all VA VISTA systems and between VA-DoD clinical systems. This project supports many other benefits and goals specific to each agency as they move in their respective directions. However, the need for first establishing enterprise automation of metadata and master data management within and between both organizations is a common requirement to achieve computable interoperability today and into the future.

The Government retains full and unlimited rights to all artifacts (code, documents, materials) produced under this contract.  All artifacts are the property of the Government with all rights and privileges of ownership/copyright belonging exclusively to the Government. 

__1.6.15.1 Artifact Repository: To facilitate the management, reporting, collaboration, and continuity of access of all government artifacts and deliverables produced under this contract as a single logical unit, all artifacts and deliverables shall be developed, version-controlled, stored, and delivered on a single inndustry-standard public Github repository (“Project Repository”) with clearly designated and appropriate licenses.__  Upon commencement of the contract period, the contractor shall establish the Project Repository, and provide the publically accessible URL of the Project Repository to the project manager, contracting representative, and relevant government stakeholders.  (Deliverable #1)

The Project Repository shall contain the sole authoritative source of all artifacts produced under this contract. Developers shall have full reqd-write (push-pull) privileges to support continuous real-time collaborative development. The government, all necessary stakeholders, and the public shall also have contemporaneous read and download access of the same developer artifacts at all times throughout the lifecycle of the contract. This team access to the same, sole source of artifacts enables real-time collaborative development, testing, management, reporting, review, and oversight of all artifacts in one location. 

By default all artifacts of the Project Repository shall be hosted on a public Github repository. Should a subset of content in the Project Repository contain proprietary, protected, or sensitive information or content,  then contractor shall use a private Github repository *for only this subset of content*, and shall document and maintain an always-up-to-date index of these redacted artifacts on the primary, public Project Repository. In addition, should there be any redactions required, the contractor shall provide a fully automated redaction and indexing script. This script shall be run on a nightly basis such that the private (unredacted), public (redacted), and index of redactions are consistent, complete, and up-to-date.  A private repository may be created and managed as either a private Github repository (a) within the primary public Github repostory, or (b) within a repository managed behind a government firewall on Github Enterprise.  In all cases, government and all stakeholders shall have full access to  (a) all repositories, private and public, at all times and (b) an index of all content, private and public, that correctly lists all content. 

For purposes of this contract, independent of whether segments of the Project Repository are hosted on separate public and private repositories, the Project Repository shall be managed and considred as a single, inclusive logical unit comprehensively spanning all artifacts, and considered Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to eliminate any ambiguity surrounding ownership of said content.

The artifacts in the Project Repository shall have the following properties and data rights:

__1.6.15.2 All data and metadata produced under this contract must be provided in nonproprietary industry-standard machine-processable, structured form on the Project Repository and carry a Creative Commons CC0 license.__  All data must include its corresponding, complete, correct, current operational metadata (schemes, data dictionaries) in machine-processable form, such that fully automated machine interpretation, extraction, translation, loading, and migration of all data to any future data storage system may be accomplished by a third party using industry-standard tools without any loss of information content or context.  If the data is tabular, CSV is required; for all other data structures JSON-LD is required. For metadata JSON-LD is required.

__1.6.15.3 All code (software) produced under this contract shall be developed, version-controlled, and delivered in source code form with associated documentation in the Project Repository, such that real-time, contemporaneous third-party review and validation of all code in progress is possible.__  The contractor shall clearly identify all source code as either original or derivative. All code that constitutes original works shall carry an Apache 2.0 license.  All code that constitutes derivative works must carry an [OSI-approved](https://opensource.org/licenses) free and open source license. 

All source code, dependent code, libraries, or third-party code shall be in portable, industry-standard languages. If the source code requires compiling or assembling, these shall be either industry-standard open-source compilers or assemblers, or shall be provided with the software under a free and open source license that has been approved by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses) (OSI). 

All code must have corresponding documentation, version-controlled in markdown in the same repository as the source code, and contain at minimum an Installation Guide and a User Guide for the final delivered source code such that a third party may download, install and make full functional use of the delivered code as specified and intended.  The Installation Guide must list all required third-party code, libraries or other dependencies. 

__1.6.15.4  All documentation and reports produced under this contract must be provided as machine-processable industry-standard markdown in version-controlled text files on the Project Repository and carry a Creative Commons CCO license.__  From the most recent version of the markdown source, contractor shall use a documentation generator to produce all documentation in required formats. At minimum contractor shall auto-generate HTML, Word, and PDF versions of all documentation from the markdown source.  All edits, updates, and amendments to any documentation must be through changing the markdown source (not by editing the generated files), and then the documentation shall be regenerated in all required formats. All generated documentation shall reflect the most recent version of the markdown source.  Approved markdown formats include Github Markdown and Docbook. 

#### 1.6.16 Organizational Conflict of Interest:  
Contractor and subcontractor personnel performing work under this contract may receive, have access to or participate in the development of proprietary or source selection information (e.g., cost or pricing information, budget information or analyses, specifications or work statements, etc.) or perform evaluation services which may create a current or subsequent Organizational Conflict of Interests (OCI) as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5.  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer immediately whenever it becomes aware that such access or participation may result in any actual or potential OCI and shall promptly submit a plan to the Contracting Officer to avoid or mitigate any such OCI.  The Contractor’s mitigation plan will be determined to be acceptable solely at the discretion of the Contracting Officer and in the event the Contracting Officer unilaterally determines that any such OCI cannot be satisfactorily avoided or mitigated, the Contracting Officer may affect other remedies as he or she deems necessary, including prohibiting the Contractor from participation in subsequent contracted requirements which may be affected by the OCI.

#### 1.6.17 Phase In / Phase Out Period:  
To minimize any decreases in productivity and to prevent possible negative impacts on additional services, the Contractor shall have personnel on board, during the sixty day phase in/ phase out periods.  During the phase in period, the Contractor shall become familiar with performance requirements in order to commence full performance of services on the contract start date.  


The contractor shall perform transition planning activities to transition business and technical domain knowledge to Pacific JITC and/or its designees via the designated Project Repository.  The contractor shall generate a phase-out transition plan that elaborates the artifacts to be transitioned on the Project Repository, and a schedule for transition completion.

##  5.3 Application Development Assessment

Overview:

Foundation Metadata Support

This creates all the foundational tooling and approach for all other segments.  This provides all the raw metadata from VISTA systems for analytics, and provides the basis for the VISTA Data Model (VDM) and the enterprise, cross-VISTA normalized VISTA Data Model (VDMN).  This task is analyzing only VISTA metadata. The task is non-invasive, and leaves VISTA systems untouched and unaltered in any way.

Read/Write Enterprise Model Support

This provides the iterative steps to generate the VDMN, and steps to operationalize this with full, secure, read/write access to a VISTA instance against the VDMN, rather than a local model. This provides global enterprise read/write capability.

Operational Model Support

These tasks involve operationalizing the VDMN for specific VISTA Application models, for external Meta-models (VPR, MDWS), and for external Reference models (FHIR).  Note: at least one VDMN embedded Application model, and at least one Reference model map shall be delivered during the one-year project.


## 5.3.0 VISTA Metadata Extraction

This foundation task provides all the raw metadata from VISTA systems for analytics, and provides the basis of a normalized, enterprise data model. This creates all the foundational tooling and approach for all other segments.   

Deliverables:

Software Architecture Artifacts (VISTA Metadata) (Deliverable #6)

## 5.3.1 Comprehensive Model Exposure
The contractor shall provide comprehensive always-up-to-date, machine-processable exposure and definition of complete operational VISTA data model (VDM), based on all data dictionaries from all active VISTA instances in standard machine-processable, exchangeable form, supported by off-the-shelf tools.

In addition, the contractor shall provide an automated, triggered update of source data model to the model repository whenever Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS), DIFROM.m  (M routine name; used by KIDS), or any other VISTA tools change the VISTA data dictionaries.

The expected results of these tasks shall permit analysis and enhancement of the true operational VISTA data model(s) and provide a data- and metadata-centric roadmap for auditing VISTA data. Full automation of this process allows this to be a sustainable, continuously repeatable process across all systems going forward rather than a single snapshot in time. (Note: since this is only metadata, no patient data is exposed or involved so is ‘safe’ from a patient data privacy perspective). 


The contractor shall:
Provide a native VISTA Data model (“VDM”) in a standard machine processable format that captures all the nuance in the model meta data, documented and maintained on the Project Github and usable in off-the-shelf tools
Provide date-stamped FileMan (FM) data model definitions from all active VISTAs: global definitions, dictionary code (triggers, transforms, indexes, computations), cross reference definitions (file .11) posted and maintained on Project Github. [REM: this information is meta-data and not specific patient or institutional data. As such, it can be housed in a standard github].
Document how “live VDM” is a maintainable item and can always represent the current state of the fielded VISTAs Support development of the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) which shall link requirements to the desired functionality and the corresponding design, development, and testing artifacts
Deliverables: 
Machine Processable VISTA Data Model (VDM) (Deliverable #7)
Date-stamped FileMan Data Model Definitions (Deliverable #8)
Approach to “Live VDM” Maintenance of Current State (Deliverable #9)

## 5.3.2 Normalized Model
The contractor shall create a fully audited and normalized VISTA data model (VDMN) with no redundancy. 
The expected results of this task shall provide the foundation for enterprise-centric Master Data Management for VISTA. It shall provide exposure of hidden pointers and unstated references required to properly expose older, cruder models used for Scheduling and Orders. This is the foundation for code reduction and elimination of multiple overlapping extraction methods. Note: The initial VDMN will focus on only a subset of VISTA (a prototypical package such as Surgery, Scheduling, etc.) to provide a full end-to-end demonstration of the methodology.


The contractor shall:
* Provide a normalized VISTA Data Model (“VDMN”) derived from VDM, documented and maintained on the Project Github and usable in off-the-shelf tools
* Generate all heuristic code used to derive the normalized model published and maintained on the Project Github
* Provide reports on normalization and the model available on the Project Github (Wiki)
* Provide a self-contained website that visualizes every aspect of VDM, VDMN and other meta data. This output must be mainstream, d3.js-based, pure web graphics framework. 
* Provide a clear report on nuance exposed (not added but made clear) in older models such as scheduling that will aid interoperability of such data. 


Deliverables: 
Normalized VISTA Data Model (VDMN) (Deliverable #10)
Heuristic Code (Deliverable #11)
Normalization Reports (Deliverable #12)
Website that graphically depicts VDM, VDMN, and other metadata (Deliverable #13)
Report on Exposure of Older Models (Deliverable #14)


## 5.3.3 Common Repository
The contractor shall provide a centralized repository for machine processable definitions of all VISTA application metadata. This repository shall provide and store enterprise VISTA (Cross-VISTA) application metadata (lab test definitions, document template definitions, surgery meta-data, etc.) from all VA VISTA instances in one place for analysis and refinement to improve meta-data creation and applications with a focus on improving interoperability of patient data.


The contractor shall:
Provide date-stamped application meta data for lab, surgery, Text Integration Utility  (TIU) notes and other applications, in a VDMN compatible format, downloadable from the VA Metadata Github and processable using off-the-shelf tooling
Generate prototypes and documentation about meta data refinement on the VA Metadata Github
Produce documentation to detail how meta-data curation improves interoperability.
Deliverables: 
Date-stamped Metadata for lab, surgery, TIU notes and other applications in a VDMN compatible format (Deliverable #15)
Metadata Refinement Prototype with associated documentation (Deliverable #16)
White Paper on Interoperability Improvement due to Metadata Curation (Deliverable #17)

## 5.3.4 Metadata Enhancement and Linkage

FileMan is currently data-category agnostic. The contractor shall modify it reflect the broad categories of data it contains to allow management (query, security, read/write) of Patient, Institutional, Knowledge, and Systems data as distinct entities and enables patient-centric security. To this end, the contractor shall divide and tag files by usage category: Patient (P, Institution (I), Know-how (K) and System (S) information (PIKS categories).

In addition, the contractor shall support metadata linkage with at least one external Linked Data source including biological sciences, genotypes, and clinical research, examples of which shall be provided by VHA as government furnished information (GFI). For example, the contractor may use clinicaltrials.gov data to identify clinical trials on rare diseases that are planned, recruiting, under way, or completed, or linkage with Orphanet to provide insight about rare diseases, their prevalence, symptoms, treatments, and connect with rare disease experts.

The expected results of these efforts shall yield: a) Highly contextualized and personalized patient data enrichment; b) access to a broad array of drug-drug interactions mined from clinical trials, scientific literature, spontaneous adverse event reports, and molecular predictions; and c) access to the burgeoning amount of pharmacogenomics knowledge, whether curated from literature or mined from genome-wide association studies (GWAS).


The contractor shall:
Provide machine-processable annotations for data categories marking the data types of both VDM and VDMN files/classes
Develop code used to categorize the models documented and maintained on Github.
Deliverables: 
Machine-processable Annotations (Deliverable #18)
Software code (Deliverable #19)


## 5.3.5 Indexing Analytics and Search
The contractor shall develop indexing analytics for query scope improvement.  This effort shall allow full exploitation of current indexing in FileMan and suggests further indexing, all based on current FileMan facilities, to improve the range of queries supported by VISTA. This effort supports cross-patient, cross-system registries and population analytics. 
In addition, the contractor shall provide multi-column indexes to allow multi column, multi-field queries. For example, an index on State and Health Factor can quickly identify everyone who has a health factor of a particular type that is registered in a particular state.


The contractor shall:
Based on VDM exposure of VISTA indexing and data, document the range of current queries supported and suggestions regarding further indexing to allow cross-patient data analytics
Provide real-time population analytics on live operational data
Demonstrate real-time query on operational data
Verify scalability to >1 million patients.
Deliverables:
Queries & Indexing White Paper (Deliverable #20)
Operational Data Prototype (Deliverable #21)

## 5.4 Application Development Assessment (Prototypes)

## 5.4.1 Secure Read/Write Normalized VISTA Data Model

As prioritized and agreed between VA Program Director and Pacific JITC, the contractor shall:
Make end-to-end example and demonstration of VISTA Data Model (VDM) and normalized VDM (VDMN) on subset of VISTA data, showing all steps, with components not yet implemented.


Provide meta-data driven export/import of VISTA data in industry-standard, machine-processable form to allow bulk read / extract / insert of data based on metadata in standard machine representation form and to allow bulk update of PIKS domains. 
All Data in the FileMan Test VISTA shall be captured in standard, portable machine-readable definitions that conform to VDM and VDMN.
Demonstrate use of FQS to export these definitions from the FileMan Test VISTA to Github. 
Github hosted prototype of importing these definitions directly into an empty VISTA with documentation on issues involved.
Fully document data insertion issues that are bypassed by VISTA current “direct to raw globals” programming style. These include triggered transformations, bi-directional pointers and inappropriate designations of mandatory and optional data types. The document should be based on the metadata exposed in the VDM and VDMN.


Provide query access to VISTA data against VDM to allow comprehensive, granular data access to all VISTA data with single common query access method and with common, open, industry-standard output formats. The output of this effort shall yield:
A FileMan Query Service (“FQS”) specified, developed and maintained on the Project Github
Query response /output options include hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible markup language (XML), java script object notation for linked data (JSON-LD), and in Excel spreadsheet compatible form.
An output option to format output as HTML tables.

These shall include “created”, “last update”, “deprecated”, “replaced by”, and “dataset version.” Distinguish metadata (“K”) files from other VISTA files. DHA shall reuse both standard (w3c) approaches and the best version control approaches already used in some places in VISTA. This will allow standardized metadata version control and auditing of all VISTA metadata and is a prelude to providing one mechanism for metadata synchronization across VISTAs. The output of this effort shall yield:

Identification of all Knowledge/Meta data (“K”) files in VISTA distinguishing VA-wide, standard (ex/Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC)), local VISTA files.
Addition of version control fields to the data dictionary of all K files and synchronization using transforms of current custom version control fields with new standard fields.
Clear identification of all K files whose update mechanisms need to be updated to populate the new version control fields. 
Specify and implement a standard metadata (“K file”) import-export format to provide one mechanism for defining VISTA metadata files as a prelude to one standard import-export mechanism for all VISTA meta-data. The output of this effort shall yield:
Format specification
Implementation of a serializer and import mechanism for transferring between meta data in this format and appropriate files in VISTA
A capability that fits with new standardized meta-data version control.
Provide working prototype of on-the-data patient-centric data security to enforce data-level patient-centric access control.  DHA shall provide:
Specification of patient-centric, data security that leverages the PIKS designations on VDM
A github-hosted, self-contained, documented, any-VISTA-installable prototype
Documentation regarding how the Patient-centric Security can leverage VA "Enterprise Identity & Access Management Services (IAMS).”
Deliver model-based, continuous sync support to NoSQL (Not only Structured query language) stores to allow shadowing/mirroring (via triggers or journal updates) to alternative NoSQL stores. This shall support DoD plans for data migration and supports VA plans for secondary use of VISTA data. This effort shall provide:
A specification and prototype available on the Project Github. The prototype synchronization service shall be implemented on the FileMan Test VISTA but be installable on any VISTA.
Provide and validate read/write access for VISTA Application against VDMN. This effort shall provide the ability to:
Expose query service of FileMan non-compliant Lab data as if it were FM-compliant
Expose writeback service of FM non-compliant Lab data as if it were FM-compliant
Prototype collaborative web based translation rules hub to share translation rules. This will provide a sharable, crowdsource-able mechanism to exchange and grow a library of open, standards-based, validated, and exchangeable transformation rules to support the largest community adoption possible. All VDM -> VDMN translation rules and all VDMN -> FHIR translation rules shall be posted on Github or Translations Hub.
Prototype a web user interface to FileMan to make FileMan more usable and accessible. This shall demonstrate data query and review via web interface to FileMan and must use commodity, industry standard, vendor-agnostic, battle tested, secure TCP and HTTPS protocols, and vendor-agnostic JS framework.
Prototype a web dashboard for FileMan status, which shall allow quick visualization of the ‘health’ of a given VA FileMan system and up to the minute statistics and analysis with visualization.

## 5.4.2 Operationalizing the Normalized VISTA Data Model
The contractor shall provide at least one of each of the VISTA Application Models, External Meta-models, and Reference Models listed below.

VISTA Application Models
The contractor shall work with the COR and VA Program Manager to prioritize the design, development, and test of a series of application models to provide a self-contained and documented prototype of VDMN to demonstrate at least one of the following:
 Lab model inside FileMan
Pharmacy model inside FileMan
Scheduling model inside FileMan
Surgery model inside FileMan
Other VISTA Application models inside FileMan (TBD).
To this end, the contractor shall:
Define the triggers (transforms) and background tasks (if any) needed in the Application data dictionaries to automatically populate FileMan conformant data from current Application data. This creation shall NOT effect or demand any changes in current Application code.
Provide a github-hosted, self-contained, documented, any-VISTA-installable prototype of FileMan embedded VDMN Application data.
The result of this effort shall allow standard enterprise VDMN model-driven read/write access to any VISTA Application using single VDMN canonical model.
Deliverables:
VISTA Application model(s)/Prototype(s) (Deliverable #35)


Meta-Models
The contractor shall work with the COR and VA Program Director to prioritize the design, development, and test at least one meta-model that:
Maps the VDMN to the Medical Domain Web Services (MDWS) Model. Currently the MDWS model is hard-coded by a collection of Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System (MUMPS) Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), and requires custom MUMPS programming to access any other data from VISTA. The result of this effort shall allow migration from MDWS RPCs to direct full native VISTA Data Model read/write access while using the same MDWS convenience methods (getProblems, getMedications, getLabs... etc.). This will allow graceful extension of existing MDWS applications to access, read, and write to the full native operational VISTA Data Model and all VISTA data.
Maps the VDMN to the Virtual Patient Record (VPR) Model. Currently the VPR model is a hard-coded by a collection of MUMPS RPCs, and requires custom MUMPS programming to access any other data from VISTA. The result of this effort shall allow migration away from hard-coded VPR RPCs to direct full native VISTA Data Model read/write access while using the same VPR convenience methods (i.e., getProblems, getMedications, getLabs). This will allow graceful extension of existing VPR applications to access, read, and write to the full native operational VISTA Data Model and all VISTA data.
To accomplish these objectives, contractor shall:
Document VISTA-ese vs. MDWS
Provide all convenience methods of MDWS from VDMN.
Demonstrate same query results of VDMN query vs. MDWS query for all MDWS calls.
Document VISTA-ese vs. VPR
Provide all convenience methods of VPR.
Demonstrate same query results of VDMN query vs. VPR query for all VPR calls.
Deliverables:
Meta-model(s)/Prototype(s) (Deliverable #36)
Document VISTA-ese vs. MDWS (Deliverable #37)
Document VISTA-ese vs. VPR (Deliverable #38)

Reference Models

The contractor shall provide a reference model that maps the VDMN to FHIR Model to allow automated, largely in-FileMan standard patient record exposure. In doing so the contractor shall add mapping definitions to VDMN and document VISTA-ese vs. FHIR.

The result of this effort shall provide the foundation for external system data model alignment.
Deliverables:
Reference model(s)/Prototype(s) (Deliverable #39)
Document VISTA-ese vs. FHIR (Deliverable #40)
