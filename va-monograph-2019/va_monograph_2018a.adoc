== VistA Development Historical Overview

 

Providing a development and historical overview of VistA, VistA had its origins in the collaboration of VA clinicians and programmers, who capitalized on emerging technology capabilities to create a better-informed way to serve Veterans. Clinical and Information Technology (IT) specialists working at various VA medical facilities deployed locally developed computer applications to enhance patient care with a focus on clinician needs. The software platform that resulted was unique because it represented a combination of modules developed by a distributed team and was a precursor to the distributed “open source” development style popular today.

VistA applications are written in Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System (MUMPS), the language more recently known as “M”, which remains prevalent in the health care arena and is the backbone of other well-known Electronic Health (EHR)’s. The decision to rely on MUMPS made it possible for local development teams to integrate diverse applications, leading to the forerunner of VistA, previously known as the Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP), in 1982. DHCP grew rapidly and was implemented by many private and public healthcare facilities throughout the U.S. and the world.

In 1996, the Chief Information Office introduced VistA. VistA incorporates all the benefits of DHCP as well as including the rich array of other information resources that are becoming vital to the day-to-day operations at VA medical facilities. It represents the culmination of DHCP's evolution and metamorphosis into a new, open system, client-server based environment that takes full advantage of commercial solutions, including those provided by Internet technologies

VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff. VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies. The Decision Support System (DSS) and other national databases that might be derived from locally generated data lie outside the scope of VistA.

This also included the development and deployment of Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). CPRS is a VistA computer application. CPRS enables you to enter, review, and continuously update all the information connected with any patient. With CPRS, you can order lab tests, medications, diets, radiology tests and procedures, record a patient’s allergies or adverse reactions to medications, request and track consults, enter progress notes, diagnoses, and treatments for each encounter, and enter discharge summaries. In addition, CPRS supports clinical decision-making and enables you to review and analyze patient data. CPRS was designed to run in both the Microsoft Windows operating environment and on text-based terminals. This rich, automated environment supports day-to-day operations at local Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care facilities.

VistA has been widely recognized as a premier, tightly integrated computerized physician order entry system. VistA represents the joint achievement of thousands of clinicians and professional systems experts.

As the implementation of Electronic Health Records (EHR) increases, VHA can claim to have pioneered many aspects of the enterprise-wide discipline. VistA’s patient-centric focus embodies the clinical workflow processes that support VA’s models of care, and VistA has led to measurable improvements in patient health.

[[what-is-vista]]
== What is VistA?

VistA is a comprehensive, full-featured Health Information System and Electronic Health Record. The software must be properly configured at each healthcare setting by individuals knowledgeable about the software before the system is used to support healthcare delivery. VistA does not self-install.

VistA supports a large variety of clinical settings. Facilities range from small clinics that provide solely outpatient care to large medical centers with significant inpatient populations and their associated specialties. The VistA applications focus on clinically relevant record keeping that improves patient care by improving clinical and administrative decision making.

VistA is deployed across VHA at more than 1,500 sites of care, including each Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) and Community Living Centers (CLC), as well as at nearly 300 VA Vet Centers. VistA serves America’s Veterans by supporting exceptional-quality health care.

[[vista-brief-technical-overview]]
== VistA Brief Technical Overview

 

VistA is an integrated Electronic Health Record system with applications that share a common data store and common internal services. The data store is a built-in database native to the M language.

The Kernel software component of VistA acts as the middle-man between the operating system and the applications, making VistA portable to different operating systems. VistA integrates its own applications with each other as well as with non-VistA systems. It uses application programming interfaces (APIs), remote procedure calls (RPCs), and Health Level 7 (HL7) messaging to communicate with commercial off-the-shelf software, selected information technology systems of other federal agencies, and health information exchange networks.

VistA encompasses many distinct applications, thousands of routines, and millions of lines of computer code.

[[where-is-vista-used-within-vha]]
== Where is VistA used within VHA?

VistA is deployed universally across VHA at more than 1,500 care sites, including each Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC), Community Living Center (CLC), and nearly 300 VA Vet Centers.

*VDL Link:* https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=30

*Full Description and Features:* The AICS encounter forms are used to display relevant patient data for use during the appointment (e.g., demographics, allergies, clinical reminders, and problems) and to collect data about the appointment (e.g., procedures, providers, and diagnoses), thus providing an organized method of data collection through scanning or data entry. Many of the lists that a user sees in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) for input of outpatient encounter data are based on lists created when designing encounter forms for clinics.A form generator is included, which allows sites to design forms that meet local medical facility needs. There is enough flexibility in the software so sites can build forms that meet their individual clinical, billing, and resource requirements. The encounter form may be filed in the clinical record. A print manager is included that allows sites to define reports to print in conjunction with the encounter form and any supplemental forms for each appointment. Reports can be defined to print at the division, clinic group, or clinic level. Utilities are available to manage when and where forms may print.Data from encounter forms can be input into VistA in one of two ways. Forms can be scanned on client workstations with the data automatically transmitted to the VistA server, or clerks can key in data from forms.

Provides a form design utility that allows creation of attractive and easy to use forms for each clinic

* Allows forms to be designed to print with patient data displayed, such as patient demographics, insurance information, allergies, and clinical reminders that are due and active problems
* Allows for the creation of forms to collect data such as procedures, diagnoses, problems, providers, progress notes, vital signs, and Patient Care Encounter (PCE)-related data such as exams, health factors, patient education, skin tests, and immunizations

* Updated in December 2015. DD change for Type of Visit File: A request was made to update the SHORT NAME (#.015) field in the TYPE OF VISIT (#357.69) file. This field is computed using a pointer to the SHORT NAME (#2) field in the CPT (#81) file; a field that was removed by patch ICPT*6.0*46. This patch redefined the computed expression used in the SHORT NAME (#.015) field to use an API to populate the SHORT NAME data. The value of the SHORT NAME (#.015) computed expression was changed to use the CPT^ICPTCOD API which will populate the correct SHORT NAME data.

ASU originated in response to a long-recognized demand for a means of implementing the "Scope of Practice" model, but the driving force behind its development was the complexity of Text Integration Utilities' (TIUs) document definition needs. Current security key capabilities were unable to efficiently manage the needs of clinical documentation (Discharge Summaries, Progress Notes, Operation Reports, etc.).

Duplicate Record Merge

*Version*: 7.3

*Brief Description:* Duplicate Patient Merge provides an automated method to combine duplicate patient records into a single record within the VistA database. It was released under the Duplicate Resolution System menu as part of the Kernel Toolkit.

*Business Function Framework Line(s) of Business:* Deliver Health Care, Manage Business Enabling

*Business Function Framework Function(s):* Manage Health Records, Utilize Information Technology Services

*VHA Portfolio:* Common Services

*Business Owner:* VHA

*VASI ID:* NA

*VASI ID Link: *

*VDL Link:* https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=2

*Full Description and Features:* The overall process is broken down into these phases:

1.  Duplicate patient records are identified by the VAMC staff or by a separate system interfaced with the Master Patient Index
2.  VAMC staff review/verify the pairs and approve the pair
3.  VAMC IT or expert users schedule and monitor merges of the pairs

Initial search and identification of potential duplicate records is accomplished by performing comparisons on key patient traits in the centralized Person Service Identify Management (PSIM) database. It is the goal of PSIM to provide an authoritative source for persons’ identity traits throughout the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).

The review/verification phase of the patient merge process consists of two levels of review before verification. The primary reviewer performs a review of patient demographic information and determines if the pair is a duplicate record, then selects the record that will be merged into the other record, which is known as the merge direction. When data from ancillary services is present, a notification (via Mailman message or alert or both) is sent to the designated ancillary reviewers.

All reviewers determine whether the record pair is a duplicate, not a duplicate, or unable to determine the status. If all reviewers conclude that the pairs are duplicates and need to be merged, the record pair is designated as a verified duplicate available for merge approval. For those pairs determined not to be duplicates, the processing stops and the status indicates they are verified as non-duplicates. If status cannot be determined, the record pair remains in the DUPLICATE RECORD file and processing ends unless the Healthcare Identity Management and Data Quality (HC IdM) team can assist and determine the resolution.

The next phase is the merge of the record pairs. A wait time may be configured between verification and merge. The merge is a non-reversible process. Once the pair of records is merged, there is no automated way of undoing the process. The application has been written to support multiple parallel jobs (threads - as specified by the site) during the merge process, and multiple pairs can be merged in a single process. However, only one merge process should be running at once.

Although the software was designed with potential to merge New Person records, this capability is not included in the released version.

*VDL Link:* https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=141

*Full Description and Features:* This system meets the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 mandate, specific to the Electronic Transactions and Code Sets rule regarding compliance with submitting claims electronically to insurance companies via the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) standard transmission format. ECME receives a billing determination by Integrated Billing (IB) if an Outpatient Pharmacy order is billable. If so, ECME builds a NCPDP electronic claim transaction using data required by the insurance company for claim adjudication, as defined within the company’s individual payer sheet. Claims are submitted during the Outpatient Pharmacy finish process, and again during the Outpatient Pharmacy release process if the claim was initially rejected. If any additional edits or other events occur to the prescription, such as a return to stock, ECME generates additional electronic claims to payers updating them on the prescription billable status and updates IB with any claim specific information.

The ECME application provides the following features:

* Creation of outpatient pharmacy electronic claims for real-time submission to third party insurance companies for adjudication utilizing billing activities within the VHA prescription fill process
* Utilization of information provided by a subscription with a vendor to create electronic claims
* Support and integrated functionality for TRICARE/CHAMPUS, ChampVA, and itemized charging methods for prescription pricing

All entities that are financially responsible for care are assigned a HPID or Other Entity Identifier (OEID), used for entities that aren't traditional health plans. This new standard increases interoperability by replacing clearinghouse-specific identifiers for health plans
* Enhanced in May 2015 to improve matching the ECME number on incoming pharmacy Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) claim lines to the claim numbers in VistA
* Enhanced in February 2016 to extend the capabilities of the electronic pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system to support the ePharmacy NCPDP continuous maintenance standards. This included ePharmacy system modifications to support new data elements for NCPDP versions E.0 through E.6, changes to the Close Claim [CLO] action on the ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN], the Rx Not Processed for Site bulletin was modified to direct the user to the correct ECME option in order to get more information on the reject, the Rx Not Processed for Site bulletin was modified to include the associated ECME number, if it exists, the he Claim Results and Status [BPS MENU RPT CLAIM STATUS] menu was modified to include a new Non-Billable Status Report [BPS RPT NON-BILLABLE REPORT] option, and the if a TRICARE or CHAMPVA inpatient claim is reversed by the inpatient auto reversal process of the BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB, the transaction will be filed in the PSO AUDIT LOG (#52.87) file as a bypass prescription so that it will be displayed on the TRICARE-CHAMPVA Bypass/Override Report, which is part of the Outpatient Pharmacy application
* Enhanced in August 2016 to extend the capabilities of the electronic pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system. This included about 12 changes to the ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN], a new Security Key called BPS SUPERVISOR which is required for anyone accessing the OPECC Productivity Report [BPS OPECC PRODUCTIVITY REPORT], several reports changes to include the Closed Claims Report [BPS RPT CLOSED CLAIMS] which will display the billed amount in the Excel download format, the Potential TRICARE Claims Report [BPS COB RPT TRICARE CLAIMS] will have new functionality and be renamed to Potential Claims Report for Dual Eligible [BPS POTENTIAL CLAIMS RPT DUAL], and a new report called OPECC Productivity Report [BPS OPECC PRODUCTIVITY REPORT]. Also, the system will now support new and modified data elements and fields for NCPDP Telecommunications version E7 according to the October 2015 NCPDP release. Support for new and modified reject codes through this release is also included. Enhancements include HL7 transmissions for ePharmacy plans, processors, and PBMs (PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGER) from FSC re-directed to use the ePharmacy HL7 link on EPHARM OUT instead of IIV EC, and the Vitria Interface Version was updated to version 5 and a new registration message will be sent to AITC to communicate that updates have occurred
* Enhanced in September 2017 to extend the capabilities of the electronic pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system to include updating the ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] and changing the system so it can support new and modified data elements and fields for NCPDP Telecommunications versions published on/after January 2016. It also included "RED" Resubmit Claims w/EDITS hidden action under the ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] will no longer allow an OPECC to enter or edit a Submission Clarification Code if the reject is pending on the pharmacist's reject worklist or if the most recent transaction is resolved or unresolved for reject codes 79 Refill Too Soon and code 88 Drug Utilization review (DUR), and changing the main screen of the ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] to display a comment for only the most current transaction. Comments for previous Transaction(s) will continue to be available when accessing the CMT Add/View Comments action from the ECME User Screen (current functionality)
* Enhanced in November 2017 to extend the capabilities of the electronic pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system to include the new VER (View ePharmacy Rx) option, and to update the CV (Change View) action on the ECME User Screen and the ECME AUTO-REVERSAL PROCESS email bulletin. The system was also updated to support new data elements and fields for NCPDP Telecommunications versions published through October 2016. The Claim Log and the Claim Response Inquiry was updated to include the Facility ID Qualifier and the Reconciliation ID, and Option PHAR (Edit ECME Pharmacy Data) was updated to require entry for the prompt AUTO-REVERSAL PARAMETER. Finally, this release rectified an ongoing problem in which some TRICARE and CHAMPVA prescriptions on the CMOP queue would be left on the queue during CMOP processing because claim responses would not be received by VistA in a timely manner.

* Enhanced in August 2018 to extend the capabilities of the electronic pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system. Several filters on the Change View (CV) action of ECME User Screen are being updated to allow the user to select one, many, or all. The user will also now be able to select a specific date range. The Rejected Claims Report is being modified to include three new filter questions, and several of the existing filter questions are being modified to allow selection of one, many, or all. The excel report is being modified to add new fields, truncate some fields, and delete other fields to prevent wrapping to another line. The Prescriber filter question is being modified to default to "A". The system is being updated to support new and modified External Code Lists (ECLs) for the NCPDP Telecommunications versions published through October 2017. The ePharmacy Medication Profile is being added as an action to VER View ePharmacy Rx. The system is being updated to allow for the new HIPAA regulatory requirements that increase the length of the following fields: Name of Insured, Group Number, Group Name and Subscriber ID. When the system builds an outgoing claim request, it includes on the claim only those fields appearing on the payer sheet provided by the payer. With this enhancement, the user will now be able to send additional fields not on the payer sheet via the RED Action from the ECME User Screen. This enhancement adds logic to transmit the appropriate values on secondary claims when the three fields are included on the payer sheet. Logic added to fields: Other Payer Patient Responsibility Amount, Amount Qualifier, and Amount Count

*Full Description and Features:* The 1010EZ functionality was replaced by the Veterans' Online Application (VOA) hosted on vets.gov. These applications have a direct interface with the national Enrollment System (ES). This application originally generated letters notifying veterans subject to means testing of yearly Means Test (MT) expiration, but that feature is obsolete. With patch DG*5.3*858 in March 2014, annual MT renewal was discontinued and a Veterans Financial Assessment (VFA) Start Date of 1/1/13 was put into place. A non-exempt veteran is required to have only one MT less than one year old as of 1/1/13, and that MT should remain valid permanently. Now, a non-exempt veteran is required to have only one MT that was less than one year old as of 1/1/13, and that MT should remain valid throughout the future. Local means test reminder letters were discontinued by patch EAS*1*106 as part of the DG*5.3*858 build.

The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act, Public Law 106-117, Sec. 101, mandates the application of copayments for veterans receiving Long Term Care (LTC) services.

*Full Description and Features:* The Health Data Informatics (HDI) package provides a basic method for seeding VHA Unique Identifiers (VUIDs) for reference data in existing VistA applications. A VUID is a meaningless number, which is automatically assigned to concepts, properties, and relationships in a terminology to facilitate their access and manipulation by computers.

The HDI package will be used by each VistA site to seed VUIDs in their existing global files that contain reference data, such as drug names, names of known allergens, and so forth. These files have been grouped into domains, and each domain will be standardized separately. As each domain’s files are originally standardized, the HDI package is used to assign a VUID to each term or concept in the file. Subsequent standardization updates and maintenance on these files will be handled separately by the New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) program.

*VDL Link: *

*Full Description and Features:* BHIE was deployed to all VA facilities in October 2004. BHIE expanded on FHIE technology by allowing textual reports to flow from DoD to VA as well as from VA to DoD. DoD implemented BHIE at 25 host sites that supported 15 medical centers, 18 hospitals and more than 190 clinics, including Europe, Hawaii and Alaska.

Historically, data exchanged through BHIE included Drug and Food Allergies, Admission/Discharge/Transfer (ADT) data, Consults, Inpatient Discharge Summaries and Notes (including Pre/Post Deployment Health Assessments), Medications, Radiology, Laboratory (Orders, Chemistry & Hematology, Cytology, Microbiology, and Surgical Pathology), Outpatient Encounters and the Standard Ambulatory Data Record (SADR).

In September 2016 LVS was deployed and now provides DoD legacy data to VA clinicians via CPRS RDV and VistAWeb utilizing Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). This allowed for the sunset of BHIE functionality. Remaining features of BHIE functionality still include support for PDHA’s utilizing the FHIE repository via the DoD.

*VDL Link: *

*Full Description and Features:* Clinical Health Data Repository (CHDR) shares computable health record data elements between DoD’s Clinical Data Repository (CDR) and VA’s Health Data Repository (HDR). Data are exchanged for patients identified and matched as Active Dual Consumers (ADCs) of both VA and DoD health care. VA and DoD conducted the first successful test of CHDR in a live patient environment in June 2006, and have since expanded.

One of the key features of CHDR is the exchange of standardized, computable (as opposed to textual) data. This "semantic interoperability" provides data that each agency can use with its own electronic decision support tools. In April 2007, VA released a program called Remote Data Interoperability (RDI), which extended the existing local Drug-Drug, and Drug-Allergy order checks to include data from all VA and DoD facilities at which a patient has been treated. This significantly increases patient safety by ensuring electronic decision support tools are based on all available electronic patient health record information rather than data from just one VistA computer system.

*Full Description and Features:* The Federal Health Information Exchange (FHIE) Program is an interagency information technology initiative between the Departments of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Defense (DoD) that enables a secure, one-way transmission of protected electronic health information from DoD to VA. FHIE offers authorized VA clinicians, including those involved in claims adjudication, immediate access to DoD clinical data about service members who separate from the Armed Forces. FHIE supports DoD's and VA's goal of ensuring a smooth transition for Veterans from active military service to civilian life.

FHIE was deployed to all VA facilities in 2002, and supports the uni-directional exchange of health record data from the Department of Defense (DoD) to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The data exchange is in the form of textual reports via a secure shared data repository.

VHA clinicians and VBA claims staff access this data in the repository through Compensation and Pension Records Interchange (CAPRI). Information available through FHIE includes outpatient pharmacy (government and retail), allergy, laboratory (chemistry, hematology, anatomic pathology, surgical pathology, and cytology), radiology reports, consults, admission, discharge, transfer (ADT), and ambulatory coding data. DoD also has made pre-and post-deployment health assessment and post deployment health reassessment data available for viewing by VA through the FHIE framework.

See also Bidirectional Health Information Exchange (BHIE) Initiative.

FHIE supports the one-way transfer of historical data on separated and retired military personnel from DoD's Composite Health Care System to the FHIE Data Repository for use in VA clinical encounters, and potential future use for aggregate analysis. This data includes patient demographics, laboratory results, radiology reports, outpatient government and retail pharmacy information, admission discharge transfer (ADT) data, discharge summaries, consults reports, allergies and data from the DoD Standard Ambulatory Data Record. FHIE also supports the secure transfer of these FHIE data to Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) claims adjudicators for use in claims processing.

*Full Description and Features:* In today's health care environment, computer systems from multiple vendors and at geographically dispersed sites are used in conjunction with core facility computer systems to create integrated delivery of information to the end-user. Linking such systems to exchange data and work together is a non-trivial task, particularly given the complexity of health care data.

Health Level Seven (HL7) is an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard messaging protocol that specifies the set of transactions and encoding rules for electronic data exchange between health care computer systems. HL7 provides an open, standards-based framework that computer systems can use to exchange health care data with each other. The HL7 standards development group is directly focused on health care informatics standards, and cooperates closely with developers of other standards.

The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) HL7 package enables M- based (VistA) applications running on core facility computer systems to exchange health care information with other computer systems. It provides messaging services and a single toolset for M- based VistA applications to create, send, receive, and process HL7 messages.

Many VistA applications use VistA HL7 to exchange data in HL7 format with other facilities and/or applications, including Anesthesiology, Master Veteran Index/Patient Demographics (MVI/PD), Laboratory, Outpatient Pharmacy, Patient Management System (PMS), Radiology, and Veteran ID Card (VIC). The VistA HL7 package is also used to integrate commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) health care applications with M-based core facility computer systems.

* Communication: Facilitates Point-to-Point and Publish-and-Subscribe messaging between two or more applications; and provides the transport mechanism using HL7-supported lower level transmission protocols (e.g., Hybrid Lower Level Protocol [HLLP], X3.28, or Minimum Lower Level Protocol [MLLP] over Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol [TCP/IP]), which provide error detection and session control; provides dynamic routing of messages
* Processing: Queues incoming and outgoing messages for reliable messaging; validates HL7 Message Header (MSH) information for all incoming messages; and sends HL7 acknowledgment (ACK) messages back to sending applications upon message receipt
* Message Administration: Provides functionality to assist the application developer in setting up HL7 interfaces by hiding the complex lower level communication; monitors message transmissions statuses; and provides reports on pending transmissions and those with errors
* Programming Utilities: Provides the developer with a rich collection of Application Program Interfaces (API) to facilitate the creation, exchange, and transmission of messages; provides a set of predefined variables to use for building HL7 messages/segments; automatically creates all HL7 Message Header (MSH) segments; and invokes the appropriate application routine to process message data when a message is received

*Full Description and Features:* The List Manager was developed to provide an efficient way for applications to present a list of items to the user for action. It is a developmental tool that enables programmers to:

• Display a list of items to the user.

• Allow the user to browse back and forth through the items one at a time or by screen.

• Allow the user to select items from the list.

• Specify the actions that can be applied to selected items from the list.

• Call List Manager again as part of an action.

Protocols are the "actions" that users can take against items on the list. A number of standard protocols come as part of the List Manager utility. Most of these are actions that allow the user to browse the list of items. The List Manager contains the Workbench programmer utility, which allows the development of a List Manager application without having to move from one development tool to another.

* Systematic entry and review of patches by developers
* Review and completion of patches by Software Quality Assurance (SQA)
* Review and release of patches by Health Product Support (HPS)
* Display and distribution of the verified/released patches to the users in the field

Once a problem is identified and a solution found or an enhancement is requested in VistA software, a developer enters a patch in the NPM. The patch is identified by software namespace, version, and a patch number. At this point, the patch entry has a status of "UNDER DEVELOPMENT" and is accessible only by other developers of the software. Once the developer has finished coding the patch and it's ready for review, SQA reviews the patch. Once SQA has reviewed the patch and no changes are required, SQA changes the status to "COMPLETED/UNVERIFIED." After the patch is completed, EVS reviews the patch. Once EVS makes the determination that it is ready for release, application coordinators/release agent change the status to "VERIFIED."

The patch is then automatically distributed and becomes available for users in the field.

Creates a patch mail message with text and installable routines that is delivered to all the sites via network mail. It allows entry of associated (dependent) patches (i.e., those patches that must be reviewed and installed prior to the current patch).

Provides flags to:

*VDL Link:* https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=137

*Full Description and Features:* The VistA Extensible Markup Language (XML) Parser is a full-featured, validating XML parser written in the M programming language and designed to interface with the VistA suite of M-based applications. It is not a standalone product. Rather, it acts as a server application that can provide XML parsing capabilities to any client application that subscribes to the application programmer interface (API) specification detailed in this document.

The VistA XML Parser employs two very different API implementations. The first is an event-driven interface that is modeled after the widely used Simple API for XML (SAX) interface specification. In this implementation, a client application provides a special handler for each parsing event of interest. When the client invokes the parser, it conveys not only the document to be parsed, but also the entry points for each of its event handlers. As the parser progresses through the document, it invokes the client’s handlers for each parsing event for which a handler has been registered.

The second API implementation is based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C’s) Document Object Model (DOM) specification. This API, which is actually built on top of the event-driven interface, first constructs an in-memory model of the fully parsed document. It then provides methods to navigate through and extract information from the parsed document.

*VDL Link:* https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=120

*Full Description and Features:* Laboratory UI uses the standard messaging protocol Health Level Seven (HL7) to communicate with all instruments. HL7 is a standard developed by health care information systems professionals to simplify the communications between computer systems that must exchange information. HL7 was adopted by Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP) as the primary communications protocol for messaging between systems and even between applications on the same system. The laboratory technologist sees very little change between the Laboratory UI and the traditional interface system. After the Laboratory Information Manager (LIM) or ADPAC sets up the files and installs the new hardware, the technologist can accession, build Load/Work lists, download, and verify the results as usual. The benefit of using the Laboratory UI is that almost any instrument by any manufacturer can be interfaced quickly and dependably, in unidirectional or bidirectional mode. Interfacing is only subject to the limitations of the instrument.

*Full Description and Features:* The Lexicon is a standardized reference for clinical terminology across VHA that enables clinical information to be recorded, transmitted, retrieved, and analyzed in a precise and consistent manner independent of clinic or medical center.The Lexicon provides a comprehensive Application Program Interface (API) that enables any application that needs to use standardized terminology to be able to interface.

At its inception in the early 1990s, the scope of the Lexicon was limited to expressing diagnostic clinical problems in easy-to-understand terminology and associating terms to coding systems such as International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), and the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA), and now includes Clinical Modifications (ICD-10-CM). Over the years, this scope broadened to provide a general-purpose utility that serves the terminology needs of many packages, including Problem List (standardized using SNOMED CT®), Encounter Forms, Text Integration Utility (TIU), Event Capture, Federal Health Information Exchange (FHIE), and the Laboratory Data Sharing Interoperability (LDSI) project.

In addition to providing terminology, the Lexicon provides a coding system update deployment mechanism. A large number of applications, packages, and services (VistA and external) are now dependent on the quarterly updates including:

Master Patient Index (MPI)

*Version*: 1.0

*Namespace:* MPIF

*Brief Description:* The Master Veteran Index (MVI) database (formerly known as the Master Patient Index [MPI]) is the primary vehicle for assigning and maintaining unique patient identifiers. A gateway in VistA establishes connectivity between VA Medical Center (VAMC) systems and patient registration processes and links to the MVI for message processing and patient identification. The MVI was created to support maintenance of a unique patient identifier and a single master index of all Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients and to allow messaging of patient information among the institutional partners [i.e., VHA, Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA), National Cemetery Service (NCS), and Department of Defense (DoD).] MVI creates an index that uniquely identifies each active patient treated by the Veterans Administration, identifies the sites where a patient is receiving care, and supports crucial sharing of Veteran patient information across sites.

*VDL Link:* https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=16

*Full Description and Features:* The MVI maintains a central index to correctly identify each patient and track the sites of interest. MVI data is maintained in a centralized, dynamic database that is available to meet multiple information needs across many applications and systems. The MVI central database, located at VA Austin Information Technology Center, is composed of a unique list of patients and a current list of systems to which each patient entry is correlated. This enables the sharing of patient data between operationally diverse systems. Each record (or index entry) in the MVI contains a small amount of identity and demographic data used to identify individual entries.

It is primarily used by VistA applications that need to enumerate unique patients at their facilities. The MVI assigns each patient a unique patient identifier (Integration Control Number, or ICN). Each index entry in the MVI also contains the patient's identifying information (e.g., name, SSN, date of birth, gender) and a current list of facilities where the patient has been seen. The MVI is updated as new patients are added or demographic information is updated at the correlated system.

Changes and updates to patient identity information are accepted based on an algorithm that determines level of confidence. The Master Veteran Index Patient Index/Patient Demographics (MVI/PD) was developed to initialize active patients to the Master Patient Index (MPI) and to establish the framework for the sharing of patient information between sites. (The original Master Patient Index VistA (MPI) and Patient Demographics (PD) software packages were distributed and installed together.

This software enables sites to:

* Request an ICN assignment
* Query the MVI for known data
* Update the MVI when changes occur to demographic fields stored on the index itself or to other facilities and systems of interest
* Obtain a Treating Facility List of sites where the patient is also known by this ICN (Each site becomes part of the network of sites that share key demographic data for patients via HL7 messaging

*Full Description and Features:* NUMI provides electronic access to evidence-based criteria that assists hospital staff in the management of inpatient admissions. The NUMI application retrieves data directly from VistA, eliminating redundancy and errors from re-entering patient records and information. NUMI was established to meet a specific business need of the Office of Quality, Safety and Value (OQSV) to provide automated support to field Utilization Management nurses who perform reviews of clinical care activities. These utilization reviews are considered core procedures to support both quality improvement and business/compliance functions central to VA’s mission. Utilization Management and Utilization Review staff review multiple significant events in a patient’s care (admission, transfer, discharge, major procedures), assessing such patient management decisions against established clinical guidelines.

The NUMI application provides the capability for local, regional and national documenting of the following utilization review activities:

• Place patient in the most appropriate level of care

• Identify and remove system barriers to providing the right care at the right time, and at the right cost

• Automate the retrieval of patient information for the UM review process

• Modify the initial acceptance criteria

• Create a log with information about events in a patient record

• Display a list of patient records with filters and search features for each review

• Provide reasons for meeting or not meeting (UM) criteria

• Enter information ("reminders") about actions to be performed in the future

• Provide the acceptable reports to comply with VSSC reporting requirements

• Maintain the data such as Facility, Provider Outcomes, and Reason codes

NUMI is deployed at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC).

*Business Owner:* VHA

*VASI ID:* 1530

*VASI ID Link:* https://vaausdarapp41.aac.dva.va.gov/ee/request/folder/e/123113/c/56/nt/-1?id=1578

*VDL Link:* https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=211

*Full Description and Features:* The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Office of Information and Technology (OIT), and the Veteran Heath Administration (VHA) is to provide benefits and services to Veterans of the United States. In meeting these goals, OIT strives to provide high-quality, effective, and efficient Information Technology (IT) services to those responsible for providing care to the Veterans at the point-of-care as well as throughout all the points of the Veterans’ health care in an effective, timely, and compassionate manner.

VHA has developed a Primary Care (PC) system that balances productivity with quality, access, and patient service. Management of patient panels in PC through mandatory and consistent use of the Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) has supported this system redesign. In a PC setting and in the Patient-Aligned Care Team (PACT) model, patients are assigned a Primary Care Provider (PCP) who is responsible for delivering essential health care, coordinating all health care services, and serving as the point of access for VA care. The PCP works together with a team of professionals which includes nurses, pharmacists, social workers, health care professions, trainees, clerks, and more.

The PCMM Web software is considered to be an important component in measuring patient demand and PCP capacity to meet that demand, as well as reduce wait times. It allows users to set up and define treatment teams, assign positions to the team, assign staff to positions, assign patients to the team, and assign patients to a PCP. PCMM Web was developed to assist VA facilities in implementing PC. PCMM Web supports both PC and non-PC teams. Teams are groups of staff members organized for a certain purpose.

The PCMM software will be referred to as PCMM Web. It is a National website and contains data for all sites. It will replace the current PCMM software accessible on the user’s desktop. An integral part of PCMM Web is the Data Migration that migrates the data from Legacy PCMM to PCMM Web. It is accessed via the VA intranet by users who have been trained and granted access. The main users of PCMM Web are PCMM Coordinators, Mental Health Treatment Coordinators, Transition and Care Management Coordinators, and Travelling Veteran Coordinators. PCMM Web retrieves provider and patient data from VistA via VistALink and interfaces with the Master Veteran Index via HL7 and Java to validate each patient’s national identity. PCMM Web synchronizes data back to the VistA PCMM files so it can continue to be accessed by existing software that currently utilizes it.

* Enables a team to be formed based on specific Care Type (i.e., Primary Care, Mental Health) and aligned around a patient, including providers across multiple VA sites and in non-VA settings for efficient care coordination and communication. Team and Patient management is possible through interactive screens with navigation links, expandable sections, and actions icons, providing an overall view of care coverage and maintenance capabilities.
* Identifies team members and specialists (VA and non-VA) involved in the care of the patient, as well as their contact information and provide modalities to facilitate provider-to-provider communication.
* Enables users to set up and define a healthcare team, assign staff and health professionals to positions within the team, assign patients to the team, and assign patients to practitioners, including trainees. Teams can be grouped together for a larger collaborative team.
* Quickly generates a team based on a modeled configuration for a specific team care type with team positions included, eliminating the need to manually create each team and position.
* Supports automated data collection for management metrics and analysis related to access, workload, and panel management for Multiple PACT functionality at the team level.
* Patients assigned to Primary Care teams are assigned as “Pending” until a Primary Care encounter is verified by a Primary or Secondary Provider, who is also a teamlet of the assigned team. The assignment then changes to “Active”. If there is an Active assignment and a Pending assignment for a patient at the same site and when a qualifying PC encounter is detected for the Pending assignment, an intra-facility transfer will be executed by the System. The Active assignment will be inactivated and the Pending assignment will be Activated. The patient can be assigned to the “Team” (i.e., the Primary Care Provider and the teamlet inherits the assignment) or to the “Associate Provider” that has a valid preceptor relationship established.
* Patient assignments to Primary Care teams are interrogated nightly to verify for Automatic Inactivation. An established assignment without activity for 24 months is automatically inactivated due to inactivity. A new assignment without activity for 12 months is automatically inactivated due to inactivity. The PCMM user is notified of the pending inactivation three months prior to the automatic inactivation. Reports are also available.
* Identifies and tracks patient assignments across stations. A Multiple PACT request enables a patient to be assigned to multiple PACT teams as required for care coverage across VA systems. This request requires an approval or a denial from all involved stations. Multiple assignment requests for the same patient for different stations are allowed, but there can only be one active assignment per patient, per station at a time.
* Patients assigned to non-primary care teams (i.e., Mental Health or specialty) must be assigned to specific providers within the team.

*VDL Link:* https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=87

*Full Description and Features:* The Drug Accountability/Inventory Interface works toward perpetual inventory for each VA medical facility pharmacy by tracking all drugs through pharmacy locations. Drugs are added to the appropriate pharmacy locations as they are received from the Prime Vendor. This allows sites to receive invoice information containing data for confirmed orders. With the prime vendor, the data is uploaded into VistA using a Graphical User Interface to perform the upload. The files are uploaded into Drug Accountability, processed, and upon verification, the pharmacy locations or master vaults are updated. Dispensing data is collected from pharmacy packages to decrement balances. Drug Accountability also provides the capability for Pharmacy personnel to display or print procurement history, drug balance adjustments, and order data.

There are two primary methods of receiving invoice data into Drug Accountability:

* Prime Vendor Data
* IFCAP Data

Both methods involve having the user place the invoice orders with the appropriate company. With the prime vendor, the data is uploaded into VistA using a Graphical User Interface to perform the upload. With IFCAP, the data is automatically shipped to VistA upon receipt at the warehouse.

The Prime Vendor Interface includes the following features:

* It automatically updates the Drug Accountability pharmacy locations based on dispensing and receiving information, and it also updates master vaults based on receiving information.
* Drugs are added as the invoice data is received.
* If the invoiced drug’s order unit and dispense units per order unit are the same as the information currently contained in the local DRUG file, the NDC field in the DRUG file is overwritten with the most recent National Drug Code (NDC) number.
* The reorder quantities for the pharmacy locations and master vaults are provided on a daily basis by way of a mail message Generic Inventory Package

The IFCAP Interface includes the following features:

* When a pharmacy order invoice is received and entered into the IFCAP purchasing system, the receipt data will be collected and compiled to an Health Level Seven (HL7) message and transmitted ‘real time’ to VistA Drug Accountability.
* Upon receiving the message, the receipt data will be stored in a temporary global, and Drug Accountability will alert the user about the Pharmacy receipt.
* After receiving invoice data into the warehouse, the transmission from IFCAP will place data into a temporary global.
* When Pharmacy personnel sign into the Drug Accountability package, the program will check for the existence of orders to process.
* If the orders exist, and the user has the proper security key, the data can then be received into Drug Accountability.
* Each Purchase Order received will be for a specific pharmacy location. If items are to be shipped/received at different pharmacy locations, a different purchase order will be created/shipped for each location

Both Interfaces include the following features:

* Vendor-specific information and procurement history is displayed for a selected drug
* Pharmacy locations are established and populated
* A purge capability with scheduling queuing is provided
* Support is provided for NDC code set and pricing for Electronic Claims Management Engine pharmacy electronic billing[[_Toc530402249]][[_Toc530402251]][[_Toc530402253]][[_Toc530402255]][[_Toc530402257]][[_Toc530402259]][[_Toc530402261]][[_Toc530402263]][[_Toc530402265]][[_Toc530402267]][[_Toc530402269]][[_Toc530402276]][[_Toc530402286]]

*Full Description and Features:* Pharmacy Enterprise Customization System (PECS) is a Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) application used to research, review, report, and manage customized drug information from First Data Bank's (FDB) MedKnowledge Framework (formerly Drug Information Framework (DIF)), which is a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, used in the enhanced order checking process.

The PECS application, through a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI), allows VHA pharmacists and clinicians to research and request custom changes to Drug-Drug Interaction, Drug Pairs, Dose Range, Duplicate Therapy, and Professional Monograph records, controlling access through a role based authorization. VHA Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM)

periodically (as needed in support of VA procedures and priorities) prepare, review and approve the customizations, which result in VA Custom drug data, which will supersede or enhance the industry standard FDB-drug

data.

The advantages to the VA for using PECS are as follows:

* All customizations will be performed at the National level to provide consistent order checks between facilities
* Use of First Databank for drug interaction, duplicate therapy, and dosing data
* More specificity in drug interaction order checks with the ability to include or exclude dose route
* More specificity in duplicate therapy order checks with FDB data
* Weekly FDB updates with monthly customization updates
* More frequent customization updates when needed

PECS does the following:

* Allows users to customize the FDB standard reference tables used in the enhanced order checking that will be used by the Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) group, Pharmacy Informaticist, and National Drug File (NDF) managers or designees to enter and update the custom table values
* Allows users to do the following customizations:

* A custom drug-drug interaction, and any important attributes for that interaction
* Drug pairs associated with a custom drug-drug interaction
* A custom Professional Monograph for a drug-drug interaction, including any important attributes
* A custom duplication allowance value for a duplicate therapy class
* Custom values for attributes associated with a custom dose range check table

* Provides a Searching capability for a user to see Drug-Drug Interaction, Duplicate Therapy, or Professional Monograph information separately or together, for chosen drugs
* Provides the following reports:

* History of custom changes for each of the five concepts

*Full Description and Features:* This type of software application typically runs as a client in a client/server environment. One of the challenges in creating such applications is establishing communication between the client workstation and VistA's M-based servers. In a secure manner over a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network, users need to be able to log onto a server, initiate activities on the server, and retrieve and update data on the server. VistA's Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Broker software provides functionality so that

GUI developers can:

* Establish a connection from a client workstation to a VistA M Server
* Run RPCs on the VistA M Server
* Return data to the client workstation

The VistA M Server continuously runs an RPC Broker listener process whose purpose is to establish connections with clients. When the listener process receives a connection request from a client, it spawns a separate handler process, which then handles all communications with the client. Once connected, the client can execute Remote Procedure Calls on the VistA M Server. RPCs are written in M and accessed through the VistA M Server's REMOTE PROCEDURE file (#8994).

*VDL Link: *

*Full Description and Features:* The CHDR generates standards-based, computable electronic health record (EHR) data elements between DoD’s Clinical Data Repository (CDR) and VA’s Health Data Repository (HDR) for patients identified and matched as Active Dual Consumers (ADCs) of both VA and DoD health care.

Clinical data for these "dual consumers" (patients receiving healthcare or expected to receive healthcare at both VA and DoD medical facilities.) Data for patients is stored at each agency’s local healthcare systems: at DoD this occurs in the Clinical Data Repository (CDR), a component of the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA). At VA, the Health Data Repository (HDR) stores the CHDR data.

The CHDR system is the link between the two repositories, and once the patient is marked "active," the data exchange is enabled. Most patients marked active are so marked by the DoD automated process. At VA, patients can be marked "active" manually, using the CHDR Administration Application Interface (CHDR Admin GUI.)

After the computed data is exchanged, it can be used by each agency’s native healthcare information system. At VA, the integrated data can be viewed through VistAWeb while triggered Drug/Drug and/or Drug Allergy alerts will manifest in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS.)

*Full Description and Features: *

The Resident Assessment Instrument/Minimum Data Set (RAI/MDS) provides a standardized assessment tool supporting the completion of a comprehensive, accurate, and reproducible patient assessment, and serves as the basis for developing the patient’s plan of care. The RAI/MDS aligns the VA’s data collection processes with private sector skilled nursing facilities. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the States require that long-term care facilities implement RAI/MDS to receive Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement. Use of RAI/MDS in VA long-term and Nursing Home Care Unit programs provides a structure for meeting JCAHO long-term care accreditation standards. It also provides opportunities for comparison of patient outcomes within and across VA and with non-VA long-term care and/or nursing home programs. The VA contracts for Caribou, which has been implemented nationally, with a gateway interface to import patient data from VistA. Data is electronically transmitted to the national database at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC). The AITC in turn uses the MDS to produce Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-III) and Quality Indicator reports. In addition, it provides the basis for the unannounced survey program.

*VDL Link:* https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=100

*Full Description and Features:* The system may display numerous messages when an appointment is scheduled depending on the availability of the slot requested. These include notification that the appointment is an overbook, the patient already has an appointment scheduled for that date and time, or the appointment cannot be made due to previous inactivation of the designated clinic. In addition, certain classification questions are prompted during the check-out process (if applicable) to determine if treatment rendered was connected to special circumstances (such as Agent Orange, Ionizing Radiation, Persian Gulf, etc.).

If an appointment cannot be scheduled because of limitations, the user is prompted to add the appointment information to a Wait List for future scheduling.

Ambulatory Care data meeting specified criteria are transmitted to the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC). Subsequent transmissions will update the National Database. This additional data supplements the existing Clinic Appointment Wait Time extracts.

The functions within Scheduling currently fall into four major categories: Appointment Scheduling, Local Reporting (outputs), National Data Collection, and Module Set-Up and Maintenance.

*VDL Link:* https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=191

*Full Description and Features:* In 2003, Enterprise Terminology Services (ETS) was formed as a subproject of the Health Data Repository (HDR) project to help standardize the terminology reference files that are used by Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) applications through the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). In FY06, ETS merged with the Data Standardization (DS) and Standard Data Service (SDS) project teams into one team, becoming Standards & Terminology Services (STS).

Historically, VistA applications were developed in a decentralized manner and could be specialized in response to the needs of individual medical centers. As a result, VistA terminologies were not always standardized. Today, there is a shift toward enterprise-wide terminology standards, which are essential to establish consistency in meaning of data within VHA as a whole. The shift from dispersed, non-standard terminologies to a controlled, centralized terminology helps VHA meet requirements for an authoritative, longitudinal, accessible, and portable electronic health record (EHR).

STS has worked closely with VHA stakeholders and partners to develop and maintain both the Enterprise Reference Terminology (ERT) content and VHA Enterprise Terminology Services (VETS) application and runtime services. STS software includes databases and tools that are used to maintain terminology content. ERT content ranges from simple lists of standardized terms to reference terminologies with fully populated semantics such as the National Drug File Reference Terminology (NDF-RT).

VETS software includes the databases and services that provide the terminology content to STS stakeholders. VETS includes deployment and application runtime services that will provide common access to ERT content in both the current VistA and future My HealtheVet VistA environments. STS has created and documented a Terminology Model, which will be used internally to structure ERT data and to provide services to VHA clinical applications. The model also supports data interchange within VHA and with various government and commercial partners.

The VETS applications are:

*NTRT (New Term Rapid Turnaround)*

A web application that is has two groups of users: external request submitters and internal

terminologists. Clinicians from the VA Medical Centers obtain an NTRT login (provided by STS) that enables them to request new terms to be added to the standardized VistA packages (Allergies, Vitals, TIU, Pharmacy). When a request is submitted, STS terminologists then use the NTRT application to track the request through a review process to determine if the request is valid.

*TDS (Terminology Deployment Services)*

A web application that only STS terminologists use to version and deploy standardized VHAT

(VHA Terminology) content and Map Sets. NTRT requests that are approved are versioned in

TDS and after a rigorous testing process are deployed to all 129 VistA production sites using TDS.

*Terminology Browser*

A web application that is available to the entire VA enterprise. This tool allows users to browse

Standard Code Systems (SCS) like SNOMED or ICD-9, Map Sets that contain mappings, and

VHAT terminology by domain (e.g. Allergies) or subset (e.g. Reactions). This tool was published in VETS v9.

*TED (Terminology Editor)*

A web application that allows STS terminologists to author new Map Sets that contain mappings. This is a Graphical User Interface editor tool that was created to replace importing content using XML files. This is new for VETS v10.

*VUID (VHA Unique Identifier Service)*

A web application that allows users that have a valid login (both internal and external to STS) to

request one or more VUIDs to use for terminology standardization purposes.

*Full Description and Features:* Mental Health Services (MHS) is currently managing a web-based application (herein referred to as the Veterans Crisis Line Application (VCL)) utilized by their confidential, free 24-hours hotline staff to make referrals to the appropriate field-based Suicide Prevention Coordinators (SPCs).

History: VCL Project is an important function to support recent suicide prevention legislation. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has begun operation of the national suicide prevention hotline (now called VCL) to ensure that veterans with emotional crises have round-the-clock access to trained professionals. The VA is partnering with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to operate the national hotline. Veterans can call 1-800-273-TALK (8255) and press "1" to reach the VA hotline, which is staffed by mental health professionals 24/7/365 in Canandaigua, N.Y. who work closely with the callers’ local VA Suicide Prevention Coordinators and mental health providers to help the callers.

Legislation has been passed requiring VHA to take specific actions in the effort to prevent Veteran suicides. On November 6, 2007, President Bush signed into law the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. It’s named after a soldier who committed suicide in Grundy County, Iowa, in December 2005, after serving an 11-month tour in Iraq. The bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to meet deadlines in providing the following services:

• Train VA staff on suicide prevention and mental health care

• Staff each VA medical facility with a suicide prevention counselor

• Screen soldiers who seek care through the VA for mental health needs

• Support outreach and education for veterans and their families

• Research the most effective strategies for suicide prevention

• Create a peer support counseling program so veterans can help other veterans

However, while the bill requires the VA to provide these services, it provides no funding.

On February 6, 2008, Representative Leonard Boswell (D-IA) and Representative Robin Hayes (R-NC) introduced the Armed Forces Suicide Prevention Act (H.R. 5223). This bill is focused on Department of Defense implementing a comprehensive suicide prevention program within all branches in the military, including National Guard and the Reserves. The Air Force implemented a suicide prevention program in the 1990’s. By 2002, the suicide rate had declined by 33% and researchers found a decrease in violent crime and family violence after program implementation. This bill is designed to help the VA and Department of Defense deal with the increase in mental health needs of Iraq and Afghanistan service personnel. Both VA Central Office and Congress want periodic reports relating to Veteran suicide and suicide prevention efforts.

Tracking cases may also allow for best practice identification. The Suicide Prevention Hotline Web Application went live, nationwide, on 6/9/2009 and the first update was put into production on 11/22/2010.Description of Current VCL Application: The VCL application provides an electronic version of the call log via a web-based application. VCL also stores information from hotline calls, which provides the ability to retrieve and view call information as needed.

The VCL application has three components:

* Log Application used at the VA Suicide Prevention Hotline by Health Services Specialist (HSS) to log calls
* Response Application used at VA facilities by Suicide Prevention Coordinators (SPCs) to document referrals and save them in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) as Progress Notes
* Admin Component which is nested with the Health Techs (HT) application. This component is used by hotline administrators and Social Services Assistants (SSA) to audit and administer the system
** In the Admin view, the Log Application stores call information that can later be used for data collection and reporting purposes.
** In the Admin view, the Log Application provides a mechanism for hotline staff to view Veteran demographic information. The application also provides the risk assessment module and the ability to identify the VA Medical Center (VAMC) closest to the caller’s physical location.
** In the admin view, the Log Application provides a means to refer a caller to a VAMC for follow-up care. The referral is directed to the VA Medical Center’s SPC in real time.
** The SPC Response Application allows the ability to document the hotline referral in CPRS in the form of a Text Integration Utility (TIU) Progress Note.
** The SPC Response Application ensures all progress notes have a common note title.
** The SPC Application is automatically updated when a SPC completes the referral process.

*VDL Link:* https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=170

*Full Description and Features: *

VPFS replaces the Personal Funds of Patients (PFOP) system that was used previously. VPFS looks different from PFOP because it is a web-based application; however, its design and functionality are modeled after PFOP. You can perform all of the functions in VPFS that were available in PFOP, with the exception of a few functions that are no longer needed because of the new built-in security controls. One of the major changes is that VPFS is a centralized system. With PFOP, each site used a stand-alone copy of the software and there were differences between local versions, such as data structures, business rules, etc. With VPFS, all sites access the same centralized application using a web browser over the VHA secure Intranet. VPFS stores all data for all sites in one centralized database. Access to the data in the database is controlled by security software that limits access according to VistA site and user role.

*Full Description and Features:* Women's Health application is a patient management tool for tracking the breast and gynecologic treatment needsof women, the procedures they receive, and the communications between healthcare staff and women regardingtheir treatment and follow-up. The application also provides some program-wide epidemiological reports whichare of use to clinicians and program administrators.

The Women's Health software is composed of three main modules:

* Patient Management
* Management Reports
* Manager's Functions

Patient Management is the portion of the software used to manage individual patient care, that is, their procedures, due dates and correspondence. Under the Patient Management menu it is possible to maintain patient data such as the date of the next PAP smear, colposcopy or mammogram, the patient's pregnancy and her EDC (due date), as well as the patient's current PAP regiment. It is also possible to track the patient's individual procedures: the date performed, the provider and clinic, the results or diagnosis, etc. Notifications (letters and phone calls) may also be tracked. A file of form letters has been included in the software, and these letters may be edited and personalized for a clinic's particular needs. Reminder letters can be queued months in advance of a future appointment, then printed and mailed out shortly before the tentative appointment.

Management Reports is the portion of the software used to print epidemiological reports such as the number of women who received a mammogram for the selected time period, or the number of patients having abnormal PAP results during a selected time period. Under the Management Reports menu it is possible to produce lists of patients who are past their due dates for follow-up procedures. It is also possible to store program statistics by date for later comparison of program trends and progress.

Manager's Functions is that portion of the software that provides the ADPAC with a set of utilities for configuring the software to the specific needs of the site. It also provides utilities for other program needs such as customizing tables, making special edits to patient data (e.g., pregnancy log, PAP regiment log), printing notification letters, running error reports, and documenting laboratory results. By using the File Maintenance options under the Manager's Functions menu, it is possible to maintain site specific parameters such as the text of form letters, the types of notifications and their synonyms, how and when letters get printed, and several defaults relating to dates.

*VDL Link:* https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=178

*Full Description and Features:* Through a collaborative effort between VHA and DoD/DFAS, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was reached to provide defined data elements to DFAS for tracking of active duty service members who were admitted to VA inpatient facilities. The MOU established the authorities and agreement for the exchange of information relating to admissions and discharges from VA inpatient facilities of active duty personnel. There is a weekly collection process of admissions and discharges for active duty service members at each VA inpatient facility. This collection and consolidation of data into a single repository is reviewed and transmitted to DFAS to a central data collection point. Each facility runs the weekly background job which collects data based on admissions and discharges for patients with a Primary or Other Eligibility of TRICARE, SHARING AGREEMENT or OTHER FEDERAL AGENCY. Upon completion of the background job, VistA will send an email message to the local WII ADT REVIEWER mail group alerting facility staff on whether there are entries requiring approval. The message indicates either potential or no potential active duty admissions/discharges for the past week. If there were potential admissions/discharges, then the message will state there are active duty admissions, reflect the number of potential active duty admissions or discharges needing review, the record count, and the time period of the report. Staff will review and process those potential active duty cases.

*VDL Link:* https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=172

*Full Description and Features:* PATS is a centralized, JEE light-client application, used by Patient Advocates via a browser, at each VA healthcare facility, to manage, record and resolve veteran (patient) compliments and complaints, regarding the veteran’s care and interactions at the facility serving them, so that issues are addressed in a convenient and timely manner.

In 2007, PATS, as part of the VistA application reengineering effort, replaced the legacy VistA Patient Representative application which had been used at VA Medical Centers (VAMC) in prior years by Patient Representatives for this purpose. Use of PATS was originally mandated as the VA's System of Record for patient (veteran) concerns, through the National Veterans Service & Advocacy Program and VHA Support Service Center, in VHA Directive 1003, and was, in 2011, brought under business ownership of the Office of Patient Advocacy Veterans Experience Program, within the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Ops and Mgt (DUSHOM), with continuation of its recognition as System-of-Record.

Patient Advocates use a cooperative effort with the patient, health care providers, and other employees at the healthcare facility, to facilitate expression and resolution of the patient’s concerns. These patient encounters, created, recorded and managed by Patient Advocates in PATS as Reports of Contact (ROCs), may originate from a variety of sources including the patient, family members, congressional members and Veterans service organizations on behalf of the Veterans receiving care at VA facilities, by direct contact with Patient Advocates or via the Inquiry Routing and Information System (IRIS), after inquirers contact the IRIS Agents.

Besides its function of assisting in resolving patient-centered concerns, PATS also provides reports capabilities for assessment of complaint trends based on its data, providing trending feedback to the healthcare facility healthcare providers, customer care, and quality control managers, for recognition of and improvement of quality of care, and for adherence to best practices.

The patient-centered activity, Patient Advocate interactions, recordation of these ROCs in the PATS database, and trending for quality management, are all in alignment with the System-of-Record recognition of PATS in the Federal Register, visible directly at: https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-06-03/pdf/E9-12954.pdf, or by publications search from that page: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys%20[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys] ’patient advocate tracking system’.

DUSHOM’s Office of Patient Advocacy Veterans Experience Program Leadership, use metrics and trending information from PATS Reports of Contact data, in their mission of oversight, national guidance, technical support, and education efforts for Patient Advocate staff within the broader context of the enhancement of the Veteran experience and patient centered care.

PATS is accessed, via https secure socket connections, through a browser, by Patient Advocates, to document, track, and report patient-related issues. Interoperating technologies include this Java Enterprise Edition (J2EE) application, running within the Weblogic application suite, which is running on servers at the hosting facility, with backup/disaster recovery servers located at another standby hosting facility. This Java application interoperates, via jdbc, with the Oracle database running on the database server, for dynamic transaction-based database updates. PATS also interoperates with each of the 100+ VistA legacy systems (VAMCs) for user authentication and authorization and employee/patient lookup, via connections known as VistALink Services, which use VistALink transport layer protocol for networked communication. For reporting and trending purposes, new transactions are migrated nightly, to the PATS-Reports database on the PATS-Reports server. This feature of PATS is directly available to Patient Advocates, during normal login sessions in the PATS user interface. In development are new PIV-managed processes with Two-Factor Authentication-single signon functionality, such that the role-use of PATS features is managed by the Role Based Access Control authorization process:

* The user opens PATS login page in their browser (also known as Application landing).
* They select that station into-which they intend to start a PATS session.
* The PATS application, running in WebLogic at the host in Hines, receives their click.
* PATS retrieves the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) xml token for this user, from the identity provider (IDP) identity repository. This token is validated at the target VistA environment, allowing the user roles to be retrieved by subsequent calls to the corresponding VistA RPCs.
* The PATS application validates this SAML token, authorizing the user for access to PATS.
* The user's PATS session object is constructed, enabling use of the role-based PATS features.
* The user interface is presented to the user.

Reports are available within PATS, showing detailed transaction data of the ROCs for detail reports, and counting reports used for trending. Patient Advocates generate site-specific reports, revealing ROC counts, types and occurrences of issue codes (some issue codes are identified and distinguishable also as ‘customer service standards’) assigned in ROCs, and other patterns, for a fiscal year or date range, for review by Facility Administrators, Quality managers and Service managers. Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) Patient Advocate Coordinators generate similar VISN-scoped reports for review by VISN Directors. Central Office and National Program Office PATS managers generate national-scope reports, revealing usage patterns, to help the PATS National Director oversee the mission and usefulness of the PATS application, and to discover national VA-wide patterns of activity to aid in the mission of the VHA Office of Patient Advocacy to enhance the Veteran's experience. These reports provide feedback to aid in pattern assessment for quality management to facilitate best practice and care for the Veterans. Some transaction data is also transmitted weekly to the VHA Support Service Center (VSSC) which provides additional report views.

PATS is supported by the VA's multi-tiered support network, including the national Health Product Support PATS team, and regional, VISN and local IT support teams. When the Health Product Support PATS team requires Developer or infrastructure consultation, they consult with Developers from the Tier 3 Sustainment Administrative team, and other infrastructure and common-services teams such as Database Administrators from the Administrative Data Repository in Austin, DBAs from the VA IT Engineering Enterprise Health Solutions at Hines, and Server Administrators at the Capital Regional Data Center in Martinsburg WV.

PATS enables users to perform the following tasks:

* Add a Report of Contact (ROC) which details a Veteran’s issue (compliment or complaint)
* Edit, close, reopen, and delete an ROC
* Send Informational Notifications to communicate an issue to an employee involved in a Report of Contact and/or the employee’s supervisor
* Send Action Request Notifications, which require a response from the individual regarding action to be taken or next steps
* Generate site-specific and National reports
* Create ad hoc reports
* Display reports online and save them in a variety of formats (Word, Excel, PDF files)

Enhanced in April 2013 to introduce the Inquiry Routing and Information System (IRIS) functionality. A new feature allows the IRIS Agent to transmit an IRIS inquiry to PATS, as a new ROC. PATS automatically rolls up data to the VISN Support Service Center to provide additional National reports. The PATS application is deployed at the Capital Region Readiness Center in Martinsburg WV, and is managed by the Health Systems Implementation, Training, and Enterprise Support team.

*VASI ID Link:* https://vaausdarapp41.aac.dva.va.gov/ee/request/folder/e/123113/c/56/nt/-1?id=1578

*VDL Link:* https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=95

*Full Description and Features:* In the outpatient setting, patients are assigned a primary care team and provider who are responsible for delivering essential health care, coordinating all health care services, and serving as the point of access for specialty care. Associate Primary Care Providers (APs) provide primary care to patients under the supervision of the Primary Care Provider (PCP). PCMM supports both primary and non-primary care teams such as OIF/OEF and Mental Health Treatment teams. The software allows users to create, manage, and define teams; create, manage and assign positions to the teams; assign staff to the positions; and assign patients to positions.

In PCMM, primary care providers have an assigned "number of patients allowed" which is compared with the "number of patients actual" to determine if more patients may be assigned to the provider. PCMM functionality assists in maintaining accurate, active patient listings for primary care teams and panels. By unassigning patients who have not seen their primary care providers in a specified amount of time, new patients may be assigned. Unassigned patients may be readily reassigned to their previous primary care team and provider if they return for care. When the maximum number of patients is reached, sites may override the maximum number allowed or add the patient to the Electronic Wait List. PCMM Wait List reports assist in the management of patients awaiting a primary care team or provider assignment.

PCMM allows entry of the providers FTEE to track the amount of time the APs and PCPs spend providing direct primary care and measures the capacity of each institution (and VHA as a whole) to provide outpatient primary care. PCMM also screens staff assignments to PCP and AP positions to assure the data on providers is correct.

The primary care patient, provider, and team information captured in PCMM is sent to the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) and the National Patient Care Database. Some PCMM information is available on the VHA Support Service Center (VSSC) website. Additionally, the Office of Performance and Quality Measures utilizes PCMM data for national reporting and performance measures.

* Uses a graphical user interface (GUI) for creating teams and provider positions as well as assigning staff to the provider positions
* Ability to assign/unassign patients to primary care and non-primary care teams and providers both in GUI and VistA roll-and-scroll
* Automates patient unassignment from primary care teams and providers if the patient has not seen their primary care provider for a specified time or when a patient’s date of death is entered
* Screens assignments to PCP and AP positions based on provider type and person class.

*Full Description and Features:* ICB is integrated with several VistA components such as, Appointment Scheduling and the Patient’s Insurance File. ICB provides an electronic list of veterans with scheduled appointments whose insurance needs to be verified. The "Patient Update" List is used by check-in and registration clerks to scan insurance cards for those identified. Scanned images are stored and are immediately accessible to verification clerks via the "Insurance Buffer Entries" list. Data from the image can be compared with existing insurance data within VistA. By using advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, insurance-related text can be entered directly from the digital image and saved to the VistA Insurance Buffer. A reporting utility is available to Business Office Managers to ensure compliance of check-in and verification clerks.

By expediting the data collection process at check-in, ICB helps a VA facility improve the patient check- in experience and customer satisfaction. It also increases insurance data accuracy and allows for standardization of the verification process.​
