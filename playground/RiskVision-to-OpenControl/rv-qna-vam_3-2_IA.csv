Each method is recognized by the Router and allows it to associate a client’s identity with the session. It is important to note that the Router doesn’t implement authentication – it merely notes how VistA responds to different sign on options and changes the client session appropriately.Session identity and details are passed into RPC Handlers along with a parsed version of an RPCAn RPC Handler may signal the Router engine to end a session The VAEC AWS GovCloud High requires all users to uniquely authenticate to the system prior to performing any actions. Users connect to the system using VA-issued two-factor authentication and service accounts also use unique IDs.",,,,,,
